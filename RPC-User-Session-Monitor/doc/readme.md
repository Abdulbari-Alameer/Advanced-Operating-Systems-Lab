# RPC Who Command Implementation

A distributed system implementation that displays logged-in users using Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in C. This project demonstrates client-server communication using Sun RPC protocol on Linux.



##  Overview

This project implements the Unix `who` command functionality in two ways:

1. **Part A (Local)**: Reads the `/var/run/utmp` database directly to display currently logged-in users
2. **Part B (RPC)**: Uses Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to fetch user information from a remote server

The project showcases distributed computing concepts, inter-process communication, and system programming in C.
